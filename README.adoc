== My NixOS Configurations

*_This repository contains my NixOS systems, dotfiles and devlopment sandboxes configurations!_*

I mostly use Darwin as the main OS for my workstations (work/home) and NixOS for WMs and servers. 

=== Features

* Configuration of OSX environement personal and for work via `nix-darwin`
* Configuration of my dotfiles via `home-manager`
* Styling of the different programs with `stylix`
* Configuration of development sanboxes via `devenv`
* All configurations are _flake_ based

*TODO*

* [ ] Integrate secrets with `agenix`
* [ ] Remove `firefox-bin` overlay when package is fixed on darwin
* [ ] Create `steampipe` module for `home-manager` similar to awscli with plugins and a configuration generated
* [ ] Create `rio` module for`stylix`, rio will be released in 23.11

I don't claim to be an expert at Nix, so there are certainly improvements that could be made.
